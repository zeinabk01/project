The ability to scale your tables in terms of both storage and provision throughput makes DynamoDB a good fit for structured data from the web, mobile, and IoT applications. For instance, you might have a large number of clients that continuously generate data and make large numbers of requests per second. In this case, the throughput scaling of DynamoDB enables consistent performance for your clients. DynamoDB is also used in latency-sensitive applications. The predictable query performance—even in large tables—makes it useful for cases where variable latency could cause significant impact to the user experience or to business goals, such as adtech or gaminghdffwgtueqyuiwpdcnbvvcsed ex at quam elementum convallis.
